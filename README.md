# A Minimum Feasible Emacs Configuration Starter Kits

Aim to satisfy personal needs with full-fleged common functionalities on Emacs,
and by slim, simple and superb principle.

_Slim_ means that avoid bloated third-parties configuration from others, get rid
of those unnecessary features and packages, keep the most minimum packages but
stable configuration with just-enough functionality as possible.

_Simple_ means that No evil mode (vim emulation), just keep vanilla Emacs style.
Get rid of functionalities overlay (that means use over two packages to achieve
the same functionality).

_Superb_ means that loading process should be as fast as possible, no leggy, no
extra checks. The configuration structure should be modular and flexible to
extend in the following days.

Such personal configuration packages are named as *freeland*, as the metaphor of
a whole free world exists with free thinking and spirits.

### *NOTE:* 'use-package' is heavily used in everywhere.
